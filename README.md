## Business Objective
- An ambitious project based on 2024 IEA Global EV Outlook Report, whose purpose is basically for strategic planning.
Ascertains the current market scenario using data highlighting the performance analysis of the markets across different areas like stock, sales, stock share, sales share, availability 
of charging infrastructure, Energy transition, 4-Wheeler EV Electricity Demand by framing informed actionable recommentations for the EV businesses to work on.
- The region focused in this analysis are: USA, China, Japan, Europe, India and the World (for reference)
- Prediction based on APS (Announced Pledges Scenario) and STEPS (Sustainable Development Scenario) are respectively present in the dataset and is also analyzed to chart the path ahead of the 
 probable factors which could drive the EV Market further for e.g. India currently has only a 2% market penetration, this study could help us understand the probable factors which could drive the further growth in the country.

          APS: Ambitious approach which assumes the introduction of innovative policies
          STEPS: Conservative approach assuming the continuation of present policy

## Key DAX Measures
### Year On Year Increase in Electricity Demand (4-Wheeler EV)
```DAX
% EV charging_gwth L5Y = 
VAR SelectedRegion = SELECTEDVALUE ( Dim_Region[Region] )
VAR CurrentYear = 2023 // or whatever the current end year is
VAR StartYear = 2019 // calculate from 3 years ago 
VAR CurrentYeardata =
    CALCULATE (
        SUM ( Main[Value] ),
        Dim_Category[Category] = "Historical",
        Dim_Parameter[Parameter] = "EV charging points",
       Dim_date[Year]= CurrentYear,
        Dim_Region[Region] = SelectedRegion
    )
VAR PreviousYeardata =
    CALCULATE (
        SUM ( Main[Value] ),
        Dim_Category[Category] = "Historical",
        Dim_Parameter[Parameter] = "EV charging points",
        Dim_date[Year]= StartYear,
        Dim_Region[Region] = SelectedRegion
    )
RETURN
    IF (
        NOT ISBLANK ( CurrentYeardata )
            && NOT ISBLANK ( PreviousYeardata )
            && PreviousYeardata <> 0,
        DIVIDE ( CurrentYeardata - PreviousYeardata, PreviousYeardata ),
        BLANK ()
    )
```    
### % Change in the EV Charging infrastructure (Last 5 years)
```DAX

% EV charging_gwth L5Y = 
    VAR SelectedRegion = SELECTEDVALUE ( Dim_Region[Region] )
    VAR CurrentYear = 2023 // or whatever the current end year is
    VAR StartYear = 2019 // calculate from 3 years ago 
    VAR CurrentYeardata =
    CALCULATE (
        SUM ( Main[Value] ),
        Dim_Category[Category] = "Historical",
        Dim_Parameter[Parameter] = "EV charging points",
       Dim_date[Year]= CurrentYear,
        Dim_Region[Region] = SelectedRegion
    )
    VAR PreviousYeardata =
    CALCULATE (
        SUM ( Main[Value] ),
        Dim_Category[Category] = "Historical",
        Dim_Parameter[Parameter] = "EV charging points",
        Dim_date[Year]= StartYear,
        Dim_Region[Region] = SelectedRegion
    )
    RETURN
    IF (
        NOT ISBLANK ( CurrentYeardata )
            && NOT ISBLANK ( PreviousYeardata )
            && PreviousYeardata <> 0,
        DIVIDE ( CurrentYeardata - PreviousYeardata, PreviousYeardata ),
        BLANK ()
    ) 
```
